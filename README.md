# ASO - Arnold's Super Organizer

ASO (Arnold's Super Organizer) is a powerful program designed to help you efficiently manage and organize your students or user groups within your GitHub projects. Whether you're an educator managing a class project or an organization with multiple collaborators, ASO simplifies group management and enhances your workflow.

## Features

- **Create User Groups**: ASO allows you to create user groups for your GitHub project. Each user group can have an optional expiration date, ensuring that users are automatically removed from the project when the specified date is reached.

- **User Group Actions**: Perform various actions on user groups, including adding all users to the Git repository or removing them from the repository beforehand.

- **QR Code Integration**: ASO makes it incredibly easy to add users to your user groups. It generates a QR code that users can scan to join a specified user group, automatically granting them access to the repository.

- **Effortless Setup**: ASO is designed with user-friendliness in mind. Setting up and using the program is a breeze, thanks to clear and intuitive instructions.

- **Automatic RSA Key Generation**: ASO automatically generates an RSA key for jwt authentication, saving you the hassle of generating one yourself.\
If you already have an RSA key, you can simply replace the existing key with your own under `./rsa_private_key.pem`
